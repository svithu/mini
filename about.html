      <p>
        In 1966, the Government decided to develop tourism in a planned and a
        systematic manner, after identifying the need to set up an institutional
        framework. The Ceylon Tourist Board (created by the Ceylon Tourist Board
        Act No. 10 of 1966) and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation (created by Ceylon
        Hotels Corporation Act of 1966) were set up duly. Created to promote
        rapid economic development, through the development of foreign tourism,
        the Ceylon Tourist Board (CTB) was a statutory body that allowed greater
        freedom in decision making and flexibility in financial management.
